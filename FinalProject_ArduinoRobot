Wheelie bot!

Summary
Leap motion controlled, three layer Arduino robot which is operated via 
hand gestures.


Include a discussion of how it will be interactive or responsive to the environment.
Hand gesture controlled robot, via Leap Motion COntroller, which moves
when hand is in controller proximity and can read hand as being far left to move left, or far right 
to move right, also can move forward by placing hand closer to controller, and backward by moving hand further.

Component Parts
Robot chasis:the base frame of a motor vehicle or other wheeled conveyance.
ArduinoUNO 
Adafruit Motor Shield V2
Leap Motion controller

Include what types of inputs/outputs/data it will use. You can also upload an image with a diagram showing how all those pieces are connected.


Timeline
What did you do in each of the past four weeks?

Week 0: Research, sourcing parts and documentation.
Week 1: Gathered parts, building frame, testing Leap Motion
Week 2: Robot assembled, controlled via arduino, communicating with Processing
Week 3: Leap motion reading hand gestures and controlling Arduino robot movements.
Week 4: Present!

Challenges
A brief discussion of what was hard, challenging, or unexpected about your project.
Biggest challenge was getting getting the motors to work together to make the robot move,
Also understanding Leap motion, and how to manipulate the code to read the gestures allowing 
the user to control the robot. 

Completed Work


Also upload the code that makes up your project to your repository.
